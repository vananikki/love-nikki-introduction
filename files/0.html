            <p class="body">
                In the year 672 of New Era, the much-revered designer King Sayet passed away, leaving three great designs known as his "legacies" behind.<br />
            </p><p class="body">
                For these treasures, nations were on the verge of war. Finally, reason prevailed and people decided to use styling contests to determine the ownership, rather than ravaging their lands. The contest was held in Rolterdan, a city on the border of Apple Federation and <a href="4-4.html"><b><font color=" #ec5f5f">Pigeon Kingdom</font></b></a>; so many stylists, designers, and models stepped onto the stage to show their best that the match lasted nine days. Because of this, the contest was known as the <a href="5-1.html"><b><font color=" #ec5f5f">"Nine-Day War"</font></b></a>.<br />
            </p><p class="body">
                None of the famous competitors got the last laugh, however. Two new stars won the final prize - young Princess Elle of the Pigeon Kingdom and an anonymous girl with pink hair. The then 16-year-old Princess Elle won two of the three legacy works and thus was given the name "The Goddess Reborn". The girl with pink hair, who called herself "Hostess L", went away and vanished into thin air with the last relic.<br />
            </p><p class="body">
                In the Year 676 of New Era, 20-year-old Elle assumed the throne and started the age of the "Iron Blood Reign". A group of 10 elite stylists, the Iron Rose Stylist Legion, was organized by Queen Elle to seize precious clothes parts across all of Miraland...<br />
            </p><p class="body">
                In the year 680 of New Era, Queen Nanari of <a href="4-3.html"><b><font color=" #ec5f5f">Lilith Kingdom</font></b></a> summoned a girl from Earth named <a href="2-1.html"><b><font color=" #ec5f5f">Nikki</font></b></a> to Miraland, hoping that she would be able to shift the course of this land's fate. From then on Nikki, her talking cat Momo, and her friends travel through Miraland, learning everything from the most basic styling knowledge to secrets that would change Miraland forever...

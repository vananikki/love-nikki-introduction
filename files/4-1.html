            <li>Apple was founded in the year 147 of New Era, after a youth named Welton fought against the rule of colonists and led an independence movement. Welton (or possibly someone related to him) became the first president. The Apple city of Rolterdan on the border between Apple and Pigeon had been formed much earlier, 600 years before the Star Era (the era preceding the New Era).</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>By Year 384, New Era, the Apple Federation Apparel Group had become one of the most influential pillars of the Apple Federation. It was also a part of the government and politics of the time. In the year 452, the then-president of the Apple Apparel Group, Ryan, became the 42nd president of Apple. He was assassinated 40 years later in the year 492. The Mercury Bank was founded around this time too, in the year 478.</li>

            <li>The Apple Federation, though modern and developed, wasn't perfect, and people there faced their fair share of hardships. However, many prominent businesses and organizations had found their place there, including the Apple Federation Apparel Group, the Mercury Group, the Amphithea Group, and the Rosset Research Institute.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>When war broke out between the League Tyr and Cloud Empire, the president of the Apple Federation and the chose to ally with the League Tyr due to influences from one of his supporters, the Mercury Group. The president of the Apple Apparel Group, Chairman Schiller, was opposed to the war, and this alongside his possession of the valuable dress White Blossom made him and the other people in the Group into targets. However, the Apple Government, who were opposed to the League Tyr, managed to repair relations with the North, Cloud, and Lilith.</li>

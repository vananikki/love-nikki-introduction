            Lies on the eastern coast of Miraland, Lilith Kingdom may be the smallest country in mainland. The climate is warm and humid throughout the year, very suitable for living.
            <br />This tiny country was established by a group of peace-loving top designers and developed a unique style full of dream, romance and fairy tale.
            Going through Lilith's cities is like visiting a lovely and romantic fairy tale world. People living in a fairy tale kingdom must be pure and cute - they really are.

            Absolutely "the dreaming fantasy paradise that can cure anything"!

                    In the year 800 of the Star Era, peace-loving designers from Cloud and Pigeon who were tired of war came together in 
                    the ruins of Ninir to rebuild and create a nation there. Many pacifists came to Ninir, and it became known as a neutral nation for artists.

                    In year 0 of the New Era, Ninir changed its name to Lilith. Though the reasoning for this was apparently lost to Miraland's
                    historians, it is suggested by the narrative that it was renamed to Lilith Kingdom to honor the queen at the time, Lilith.

                    Lilith Kingdom was ruled by its queen Nanari; however, she abdicated due to sickness. She appointed Nidhogg as Prime Minister of Lilith to handle political affairs. 
                    However, during the Fantasy Styling Contest of the year 680, Nidhogg rebelled against the kingdom and Nanari went missing, resulting in her brother, Prince Royce, assuming the throne.

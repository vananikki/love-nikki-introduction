                        King Sayet left three legacy treasures behind when he died, and the nations of were on the verge of war. They instead decided to resolve the dispute with a styling contest. It was held in the Apple city Rolterdan, and lasted for 9 days.
                    </p><p>
                        Though it is looked back upon peacefully, the reality was less so. Many countries ended up using their full strength to come up with recipes and materials, and the competitions were so high-stakes that entire cities ended up losing all of their clothing and designs. It's said that in a way, the war was a manifestation of the energy that had been suppressed for the three hundred years that the Blood Curse had been in effect.
                        A young Yue Qianshuang and her uncle, warriors of the Yue Clan, were sent on a mission in a team of eight people to deliver the treasures of the Cloud Empire to Rolterdan. Though the trip was not expected to be dangerous, six of the eight people who went, including Yue Qianshuang's uncle, died before the trip was completed.

                        Instead of one of the established stylists of Miraland winning, two newcomers won: 16-year-old Princess Elle from <a href="VANA_files/4-3.html" title="Pigeon">Pigeon</a>, and a girl nobody knew with pink hair known as Hostess L. Princess Elle got two of the three treasures, and Hostess L got the third.
                    </p><p>
                        Hostess L disappeared almost immediately after the war with the third treasure.
                    </p><p>
                        Princess Elle became known as the Reincarnated Goddess, and after four years, she rose to became the queen of Pigeon, at which point she established the Iron Rose Stylist Legion
                    </p><p>
                        Questions still remain among the people of Miraland. Who is Hostess L, and where did she go? Did Queen Elle create the Iron Rose in order to protect Hostess L? Were the legacies of King Sayet even real? How can Queen Elle's reign of the Iron Rose be stopped? Nobody is quite sure of the answers.

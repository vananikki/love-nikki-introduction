            Queen Nanari introduced Nikki and Momo to the world of Miraland, dueling Nikki by wearing outfits to demonstrate the mechanics of "styling battles". She leaves and Nikki and Momo end up in a small city under the name of Wheat Field.

            Shortly afterwards, they meet a girl named Aron, and have a styling contest based on sport clothes with her. Nikki wins and meets Bobo, who was impressed by Nikki's styling skill and explains that they are on the border of Lilith Kingdom and the Apple Federation. She then offers to show Nikki and Momo around town, and their adventure begins...

                Nikki finds herself feeling lonely without Lunar standing by their side, since she decided to remain behind to gather more materials. After Momo insults Bobo though, the topic quickly changes as she brings up the lovely, fantasy style to Lilith. Momo then suggests that she and Nikki compete to see if she can pull off this look.
                The girls chat about the upcoming theater held by the December Troupe when a handsome man, Royce, interrupts them by demanding he be let inside. He decides to sneak in when he is still forbidden access and brings up a secret path that leads to the inside of the theater, so the girls decide to follow him. But a Passerby Girl stops them, telling them that she can show them the way but only if they compete with her first.
                The girls admire the machinery room of the theater when they happen to overhear the Manager speaking to a strange girl about someone's presence.
                She is shocked to find Nikki and the others within the room and complained over how difficult things have been lately, what with thieves and finding people. She tells them to return tomorrow since the Troupe is on leave that day; but will only allow them to return if they can defeat her.

            <li>In ancient times, the world was guarded by two sisters, Bixiao and Chixiao, who guarded the day and night respectively and could only meet when an eclipse occurred. As the humans grew more and more war-hungry, Bixiao became worried. The eclipse came, and Bixiao was alarmed to discover that her sister Chixiao was just as war-hungry as the humans. Chixiao's power tore Bixiao into four wills of war, and Bixiao realized she had to fight war with war.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>From then on, Bixiao was there to stop Chixiao when she became out of control. She managed to seal Chixiao into a circle within the clouds above Brocade City before falling asleep herself, unwilling to see her sister be destroyed and hoping that one day the blood of the emperor could awaken them again.</li>

            <li> Early in its history, there were a King and Queen who met when they were young, and were known as King Saint Cloud and Queen Saint Phoenix. The queen was from a low-blooded family, but was very wise and courageous, and came to be admired by every girl in the Cloud Empire.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>As an adult, the king of Cloud met an oracle in his dream, and was told to build a tower that scraped the heavens. It took decades to build, and was called the Tower of Zen. The building of the tower was largely opposed by the population of the time, with the exception of the Queen. The emperor asked the most mysterious stylist family of the time to design the ceremony suit, which was designed based on the theme of Dragon-Phoenix.</li>
           <br /> <li>Only an accomplished king could ascend the Tower of Zen and reach the heavens. When this happened, an azure dragon appeared. The queen ascended as well, and phoenix appeared above the tower, its plumes dyeing clouds like burning fire. For this reason, it's believed that the king and queen were reincarnated from the dragon and the phoenix.</li>
